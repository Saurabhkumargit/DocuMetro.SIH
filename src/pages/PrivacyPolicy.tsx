                Since this project is built for Smart India Hackathon 2025 and directly handles 
                sensitive government documents, privacy is critical to ensure compliance, data 
                confidentiality, and trust in the solution. This policy ensures transparency in 
                our data handling practices and demonstrates our commitment to protecting sensitive 
                information in accordance with government standards and regulations.
